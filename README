		+-- main: Project files included in the solution
		+-- test: Test project files included in the solution
		+-- features: Features used by Capybara + Cucumber
		+-- lib2: Dependencies used by the projects that can't be installed with bundler
		+-- tools: Tools used to run tests, msbuild tasks, etc.
		

If you are not familiar with BDD please read my post with the introduction to the BDD at http://orthocoders.com/2010/05/26/real-world-bdd-introduction.

Prerequisites to run it:
	* Install ruby.
		Here some instructions: http://rubyinstaller.org/

	* Make sure ruby is in the path, then run the following commands:
		- gem update --system
		- gem install rake bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
	
	* Install jRuby
		- Go to http://jruby.org/
		- install celerity: jruby -S gem install celerity
	
Prerequisites to modify it:
	* VS 2010
	* ASP .NET MVC 2: http://www.asp.net/mvc
	
		
Sanity check:
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake -T", u should see all the tasks.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake setup", all the dependencies should be installed for you.
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake build"
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "rake test:all", all tests should run, u should see the output on the command window.
	* Open the solution and run the web application
	* From command prompt, on the root of the project run "cucumber", you should see something like:
			3 scenarios (3 passed)
			13 steps (13 passed)

If u r attending the presentation and have any issues setting up the code let me know and I'll help you with the setup.
